General Info
Financial inclusion is a critical aspect of economic development, and this project focuses on assessing the state of financial inclusion in Africa. Through data analysis and machine learning, we aim to gain insights into factors affecting financial inclusion and propose solutions to improve access to financial services across the continent.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Features
Data collection and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Machine learning models for predicting financial inclusion.
Data visualization.
Evaluation metrics for model performance.
Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-inclusion.git
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the analysis and models.

Usage
This project can be used for:

Assessing the current status of financial inclusion in Africa.
Predicting financial inclusion based on various socio-economic factors.
Visualizing data and insights for decision-making.
Project Status
This project is currently in progress. We have collected and preprocessed the data, performed EDA, and built initial machine learning models. Further improvements and optimizations are ongoing.

Room for Improvement
Areas for improvement and future work include:

Fine-tuning machine learning models for better accuracy.
Incorporating additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
Deploying a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring of financial inclusion indicators.
